This option is suitable for scenarios in which tasks need to be executed at a fixed interval. Specify the interval in the following format: `rate(<Execution interval value> <Execution interval unit>)`. For example, specify `rate(5m)` to run the command every 5 minutes. When you specify an interval, take note of the following limits:

Each time the command is run, the system waits 3 minutes before the system runs the command again.
